## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  It allows you to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to variables easily.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  There's a data structure on the right side, the object variable, with the properties that need to be destructured on the left side inside of a set of curly braces.
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  Declare the variable, following by the opening brackets with the indexes of each variable separated by commas, a closing bracket, an assignment operator, and then the name of the object.
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  If the curly braces/square brackets are on the right hand side of the operator, a new object/array literal is being created; whereas if it's on the left hand side, it's being destructured.
